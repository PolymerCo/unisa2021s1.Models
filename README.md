# unisa2021s1.Models

These models are the ones created during my UniSA 2021 Semester 1 Game Asset Design course. 

All models are free to use, however certain textures are unfortunately unable to be shared. The texture links still exist in Blender, so re-linking with your own textures can be done.

See the licence file for licencing.
